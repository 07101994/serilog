**Status** - Serilog is still working towards 1.0. It is capable of satisfying the needs of many applications, but still has room to evolve. If you're interested, and don't mind the occasional (well-considered) breaking change, Serilog can work for you. We'd like the project to reach its first RTM milestone in late 2013/early 2014.
